# EdabitExercises
Daily coding practice with Edabit. Should ideally have daily commits!!

There are three accounts commiting to this repo; nora-hansen, norahha, and nurenurenur. They are all me, I just forget I have different accounts on my computers (for some reason).

The challenges I'm doing so far (2023-09):
- JavaScript (Confident)
- C++ (Fairly confident)
- Swift (Newbie)
- Java (Newbie)
